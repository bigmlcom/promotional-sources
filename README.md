===================

Promotional Sources Template

A set of sources, with field names, labels, descriptions and types, to be uploaded with bigmler.

Each bigmler statement uploads a source, using four files:

source-desc.txt: A description for the source
source-fields.csv: All the field names, labels and descriptions
source-types.csv: All the field types
source.csv: The source itself. A CSV or whatever compatible source (TSV, ARFF, ZIP, GZ, BZ2,...)

The bigmler call includes a source name, tags, category and locale.
