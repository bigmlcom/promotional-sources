The aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it in one of the 16 groups:

 - Class 01 refers to 'normal' ECG
 - Classes 02 to 15 refers to different classes of arrhythmia
 - Class 16 refers to the rest of unclassified ones.

For the time being, there exists a computer program that makes such a classification. However there are differences between the cardiolog's and the programs classification. Taking the cardiolog's as a gold standard we aim to minimise this difference by means of machine learning tools.
